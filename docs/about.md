My name is Geoff Nichols. I have created this site to provide information about management software for embedded systems (or systems with an embedded component). 

The acronym OAMP describes some common areas of concern:
1. Operations
2. Administration
3. Maintenance
4. Provisioning
5. Troubleshooting

You can find pages describing each of these areas on this site.

If you have any questions, please email me at geoff.nichols@oampsoftware.com
