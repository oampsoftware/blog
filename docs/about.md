My name is Geoff Nichols and I created this site to contain reference material that I find interesting. This will mostly include all things related to management of embedded devices or `OAMP Software`. 

The acronym OAMP describes some common areas of concern:
1. Operations
2. Administration
3. Maintenance
4. Provisioning
5. Troubleshooting

You can find pages describing each of these areas on this site.

If you have any questions, please email me at geoff.nichols@oampsoftware.com
